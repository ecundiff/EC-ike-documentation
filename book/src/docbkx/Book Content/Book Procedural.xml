    <para>Generally, Imperative Knowledge can pertain to Clinical Decision Support (CDS), such as

    <para>Applied Imperative Knowledge can enable the use of CDS, Clinical Pathways, and Knowledge

        <para>In order for the vision of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) CDS
            Roadmap Steering Committee to be achieved, the science of CDS needs to support
            implementers, clinicians, and technology vendors in developing CDS tools that are
            shareable, standards-based, publicly-available, and patient-centered. Namely, the
            translation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines into implementable clinical
            tools needs to occur in a manner that is consistent, systematic, and comprehensive.
            There have been a number of historical efforts that have aimed to achieve interoperable
            and robust CDS tools and artifacts that appropriately translate guidelines into care.

            study. [12] In IQ-MAPLE, the investigators designed CDS interventions in the EHRs of
            four study sites to alert physicians when a candidate problem (e.g., Asthma,
            Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia) was detected that was missing from the patient's problem
            list (i.e., absence of structured input of diagnosis codes/terms to specify the key
            condition of interest). The clinician would then be able to accept the alert and add the
            problem, override the alert, or ignore it entirely. The investigators conducted a
            randomized trial and evaluated the effect of the problem list alert on three endpoints:
            alert acceptance, problem list addition rate and clinical quality. </para>
        <para>In IQ-MAPLE, a team of clinical experts and informaticians designed and validated a
            series of problem inference algorithms, using rules-based techniques on structured data
            in the EHR and natural language processing on unstructured data. Then, they created CDS
            rules for suggesting conditions to add to a patient’s problem list that may have included:<itemizedlist>

                    <para>queries for the presence or absence of a diagnosis code (e.g.,

            </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>Even though the CDS rules and value sets in the IQ-MAPLE study were created centrally,
            there would have inevitably been variation in the implementations of the rules against
            clinical data at the four study sites. A report produced out of the collaboration
            between the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)
            and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) stated that there are at least four important
            technical challenges to sharing and therefore standardizing implementations of CDS
            content: (1) insufficient standardization of patient data representation; (2)
            insufficient standardization of CDS knowledge representation; (3) insufficient
            standardization of CDS integration mechanisms; and (4) a need to align with broader
            standardization initiatives. [13]  </para>
        <para>Fundamentally, the representation and usage of clinical data and CDS knowledge across
            the four IQ-MAPLE study sites would have varied. One of the reasons that CDS
            interventions are difficult to implement between health care systems is because
            different EHR systems and health care systems utilize different underlying patient data
            models and CDS integration mechanisms. Even different instances of use of the same EHR
            systems differ in how they represent patient data. The ONC and NAM report stated that
            "because CDS relies on inferencing using patient data, this heterogeneity in patient
            data representation poses an immense obstacle to sharing CDS." [13] In IQ-MAPLE, there
            were likely vast variations in the EHR user interfaces for how clinical data was entered
            in problem lists, representation of lab results, status and recording of currently
            active medications, and other miscellaneous clinical data inputs in patients’ encounter
            notes.</para>
        <para>In addition, there were likely variations in the usage of the value set and
            terminology content at the four study organizations. Therefore, there may have been
            discrepancies in how the CDS rules were triggered when they were deployed. For example,
            perhaps physicians at one of the study sites had been trained to use only diagnosis
            codes that align with Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) codes in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services's (CMS)
            risk-adjustment model. These physicians would not have used any other diagnosis codes
            that may have existed in the IQ-MAPLE authored value sets for the CDS alerts. The other
            three study sites may not have operationalized such specific workflows, thereby reducing
            the standard representation of the IQ-MAPLE CDS alert implementations between the
            different medical centers. </para>
        <para>The following challenges plaguing CDS implementations were described in a report
            produced out of the collaboration between the ONC and the National Academy of Medicine.

                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
        </para>
        <para>These challenges are due in part – according to the summary of Kawamoto's commentary
            in the ONC and NAM report – to a lack of clear standards for CDS content representation:
            "standards are not always defined clearly enough, so a developer will make a decision
            that enables content to work within [test] systems...but are not scalable nationally."
            [13] Consequently, there are vendor-specific solutions and organization-specific
            solutions that exist with "either a laborious configuration of external licensed content
            or a laborious reinvention of the wheel as the organization creates its own content."
            [13] Instead of creating a knowledge representation based on a standardized clinical
            data representation, current efforts are focused on creating and re-creating one-off
            "solutions". Even the latest CDS content standards, including Clinical Quality Language
            (CQL), CDS Hooks, and OpenCDS have yet to achieve "the necessary level of detail in the
            standards and how they are applied to clinical decisions." [13] </para>
        <para>Therefore, one of the overarching challenges of standards that aim to make CDS
            shareable and interoperable is that there is currently not a robust way to associate
            rules in knowledge-based systems with other dependencies in clinical data representation
            systems to ensure proper operation. Current CDS standards are silent on the notion of
            identifying a safe configuration of dependencies between (a) the expression-logic for
            rules-based CDS techniques, (b) the value sets with codes and terms to define clinical
            concepts of interest contained in the CDS rules, and (c) the variability of how clinical
            data within the value sets and rules are inputted, modeled, and stored in data
            repositories. </para>
        <para>These challenges have been explored by Wright et al when they studied CDS
            functionality at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and illustrated ways in which clinical
            decision support systems malfunction and identified patterns of such malfunctions. [14]
            As a part of this study, a survey of 29 Chief Medical Information Officers (CMIOs)
            showed that 93% of CMIOs experience CDS system malfunctions, and two-thirds experienced
            the malfunctions at least annually.

        <title>Monitoring CDS - Design &amp; Testing Considerations</title>
        <para>As described above, Wright et al learned that Brigham and Women’s Hospital did not
            have a system to track the siloed components of their EHR and CDS systems, nor did they
            have a process for tracking changes to the CDS rules, logic, and terminology
            implementations that were tied to other dependencies upstream or downstream in the
            implementation and process flow. Therefore, in IQ-MAPLE, the investigators tried to keep
            a closer eye on the design and functionality of CDS tools, including the background work
            required to update and maintain these complex systems.</para>
        <para>To test the validity of their IQ-MAPLE CDS alert implementations, each study site
            organization might have built a testing environment to implement the CDS rules to detect
            whether each suggestion of a condition to add to a patient’s problem list was
            “appropriate” or not. Such a testing environment would
            <?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190717T112906-0600" comment="The first sentence says &quot;might have built a testing environment.&quot;  Thus, should this say &quot;might allow&quot; or &quot;would allow&quot; instead?  Need to ensure the tense agrees in the paragraphs in this section." flag="done"?>allow<?oxy_comment_end?>
            the CDS alerts to “silently” fire after they were built. In other words, the alerts were
            built and set to fire on patients in the back-end of the systems. End-users would NOT
            receive alerts at this stage. The alerts would “silently” fire for two weeks or some
            other agreed upon trial period. Then, the implementers would generate the list of
            patients for whom the silent alerts fire. </para>
        <para>Next, basic face-validity would be performed upon perusal of the patient lists for
            whom the alerts silently fired. For a condition with a high prevalence like
            hypertension, an implementer may not be surprised to see hundreds of alerts firing in a
            2-week span in their hospital, clinic, or medical center. Conversely, if the condition
            for a problem-list suggestion CDS rule is rarer, such as Sickle Cell Disease, then it
            would not be surprising to only see a handful of alerts fired in a 2-week silent run. If
            implementers thought that the count of alerts seemed off based on condition prevalence,
            then this could inform an analysis of the alert implementation and/or rules without
            having to do a more time-consuming chart-audit. </para>
        <para>Next, patient charts for whom the alerts silently fire were abstracted to validate
            that the alerts fired on appropriate people. In this step, it may suffice to validate a
            smaller subset of patient records rather than validating hundreds of patient charts for
            whom alerts may silently fire. If the alerts were accurate at some threshold (e.g., 90%)
            based on the chart audit, then the alert could be marked as “appropriate” at a given
            institution. If inaccuracies arise in the chart audit during the silent firing testing
            phase, it may reveal errors in the implementation, or in the rules themselves prior to
            go-live deployment. </para>
        <para>This sort of CDS testing environment would also allow for intra-organizational
            comparison of value set implementations or to assess the impact of inter-organizational
            updates to standard clinical terminologies over time. It could also be used to detect
            changes to CDS expression logic or rule changes and study the impact on the clinical
            data prior to deployment to better understand the impact of proposed updates.

            <title>Metrics for Monitoring CDS Implementations</title>
            <para>This section will describe quality metrics for monitoring CDS performance. The ONC
                and NAM report highlighted the impetus for measuring whether CDS interventions are
                working: “To optimize CDS and increase adoption and acceptance, it will be critical
                to determine which interventions are firing at the appropriate times and are then
                accepted by the clinical care team and patients and changing care for the better.
                This capability will be important at both the local and national scale if the goal
                is to reduce the burden on providers and health systems to each identify important
                lessons on their own." [14]</para>
            <para>To address this need, a range of quality metrics can be used to assess the
                effectiveness and impact of CDS interventions. The following table (<xref linkend="examplemeasures"></xref>) provides examples
                of commonly captured measures. </para>

                <para>A CDS malfunction (aka true positive anomaly) occurs when the CDS rule does
                    not function as it was designed or expected to. The question that an evaluator
                    of CDS interventions may ask is: <emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Given what we
                            expect to happen (the expected number of alert events), how many events

        <title>Historical Context for Representing the Expression Logic of CDS</title>
        <para>While there have been advancements over the past few decades in implementing clinical
            data standards (e.g., SNOMED CT®, LOINC®), there is still room to improve portability of
            CDS implementations across healthcare organizations. Different health care institutions
            may increasingly have their clinical data encoded according to standards-based
            terminologies, but each site will still require human intervention and hand-crafted
            implementations of computerized CDS, including patient safety alerts and health
            maintenance reminders intended to improve population health. One implementation of a CDS
            alert at a given institution is not completely transferrable to another institution,
            even if the organization is using the same Health IT system. Analysts at each
            organization will have to modify the underlying query so that it is computable against
            their respective clinical database structure. Furthermore, not all clinical concepts are
            recorded and stored in the same way in different EHR implementations; what may be
            structured in one system may be free text in another. While the Health Quality Measure
            Format (HQMF), Quality Data Model (QDM), and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) are the
            more recent efforts to improve standard representations of CDS expression logic, efforts
            date back to the mid 1970’s when early implementers of computer-based clinical
            information systems were first recognizing the value of computer-based decision support
            into their designs. </para>
        <para>Notably, Clem McDonald’s work on the Regenstrief Medical Record System exemplifies
            important early work in pseudocode logic expression. McDonald realized that the number
            of CDS reminders and alerts would quickly increase, so rather than hand-crafting each
            rule into computer code with programmers, he created one of the first CDS rule languages
            called CARE. The CARE language allowed clinical experts and those without programming
            expertise to structure if-then logic alerts using a flexible scripting language that
            could be interpreted by programmers to implement against the patient record system. As
            computerized EHRs continued to spread to other academic medical centers in the years
            that followed, it became clear that a standard way to replicate the expression logic of
            CARE-style if-then decision rules would be needed. In the late 1980s, informaticists at
            Columbia led an important initiative to standardize CDS scripting language and created
            the Arden Syntax or Medical Logic Modules, the goal of which was to encode if-then-else
            rules in a standard format that could be computed against different EHR systems,
            regardless of the location or specific vendor. Arden Syntax logic modules were novel in
            that they consisted of standard sections called ‘categories’, and each category
            contained several ‘slots’. For instance, the ‘logic’ slot contained the actual clinical
            logic of a rule, and the ‘action’ slot defined the message that the rule would display
            to the clinician-user. Modern EHRs often still use this framework even if the full Arden
            Syntax is not used: when a clinician’s workflow reaches a trigger point, then a rule in
            the system is fired, and evaluates the clinical logic attached to the trigger point.

        <para>By the mid 1990’s, CDS rules using the Arden Syntax began to spread to numerous
            commercial systems, however dissemination was limited in that rules written in one
            facility would not run against any other system. While the ‘logic’ slot contained
            machine-executable if-then-else code, there was also a ‘curly brace’ part of the syntax
            that only contained a human-readable textual description of the database process and
            actions necessary for the rule to access clinical data in the EHR. This required
            human-interpretation and hand-crafting at each specific site and this challenge was
            referred to as the “curly brace problem”. [19] This challenge to achieve portability
            across environments has persisted throughout the 1990s to 2000s to the current day.
            These challenges were only worsened when guideline-based techniques were introduced
            attempting to separate clinical problems into a series of linked clinical decisions.
            There were some notable efforts such as Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF), PROforma,
            SAGE, and GEM, which aimed to incorporate a guideline’s logic into the executable part
            of decision logic, however these languages suffered due to a lack of maturity of
            standards to integrate the guideline engines into EHRs directly. [19] </para>
        <para>In 1998, HL7® found the “curly brace” problem to be unsolvable by the Arden approach
            and began efforts to create expression logic standards based on HL7® Version 3 Reference
            Information Model (RIM). One attempt was the GELLO Expression Language, which in theory
            was supposed to access and manipulate clinical data by common clinical entities; however
            RIM was not proven to be a very practical representation of the complexity of real-world
            data. Only a small number of vendors were successfully able to implement RIM-based EHRs
            and therefore the vision of GELLO and HL7® V3 efforts remained unproven. In 2013, HL7®
            replaced GELLO with “Event, Condition, Action” (ECA), an expression in XML data
            structures intended to abstract the representation of expression logic. Shortly
            thereafter, the standards community realized the benefit in aligning CDS logic
            expression with those of eCQMs, as the goals of CDS rules are often used to prompt
            clinicians to achieve improved clinical quality outcomes. Therefore, HL7® defined the
            Quality Improvement and Clinical Knowledge model (QUICK). QUICK and ECA have now been
            wrapped up into the Clinical Quality Language (CQL), which attempts to capture lessons
            learned from Arden, GELLO, and ECA. </para>
        <para>An emerging HL7® International standard that might help with electronic processing of
            eCQM and CDS logic is CQL, a new specification that focuses on a common model for
            representing expression logic for CQMs and Clinical Decision Support. According to CMS’
            eCQI Resource Center, CQL will be used in all quality measure specifications in the
            future, will replace the Quality Data Model (QDM), and is intended to reduce the burden
            on implementers for consuming measure artifacts. CQL representations of eCQMs will
            replace the QDM pseudocode historically published in HQMF files; it aims to provide a
            human-readable, conceptual-level language to define eCQMs and clinical decision support
            independent of specific data models, such as the QDM or FHIR®. </para>
        <para>CMS is rapidly rolling out the CQL standard in its eCQMs and CDS for the 2019
            reporting year. The goal of CQL moving forward is to use emerging Application
            Programming Interfaces like FHIR®

            a way to allow for more direct access to clinical data that does not require the
            overhead of RIM mapping. [20] The potential for FHIR® and CQL in CDS and eCQM
            implementations remains to be seen, however, the community is optimistic. </para>

            <para>Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) "are a specific set of practices that are
                required to be initiated and followed when specific circumstances arise. In clinical
                care, clinicians have historically been familiar with SOPs in specific types of
                restricted contexts. For example, emergency room physicians have SOPs for patients
                who are brought in an unconscious state; nurses in an operating theater have SOPs
                for the forceps and swabs that they hand over to the operating surgeons; and
                laboratory technicians have SOPs for handling, testing, and subsequently discarding
                body fluids obtained from patients."</para>
            <para>Now that EHRs and electronic clinical data in some capacity are essentially
                ubiquitous in the United States, Health Information Technology (IT) implementations
                often come with tools making it possible to achieve SOPs "into routine clinical
                practice; that is, not for special patients (e.g. those who are unconscious) or for
                special circumstances (e.g. clinical trials), but for every patient in everyday

                Practice <?oxy_comment_end?>Guidelines</title>
            <para>Clinical Practice Guidelines are systematically developed statements on medical
                practices that assist a clinician in making decisions about appropriate diagnostic
                and therapeutic healthcare services for specific medical conditions. These
                guidelines should be evidence-based and use research evidence along with clinical
                expertise and patient preferences in providing care. Guidelines are usually
                developed by authoritative professional societies and organizations. Guidelines
                provide clinicians and patients the recommendations for screening, diagnostic and
                therapeutic actions that are known or believed to favorably affect the health
                outcomes of patients. Guidelines are not meant to replace the clinical judgement of
                the individual provider or establish a standard of care. They are meant to be
                flexible and are only considered as recommendations. Where Guidelines are meant to
                be flexible, standards are a rigid set of criteria, meant to be followed under any
                circumstances. [21] </para>

                    research procedures. [22]  </para>
                <para>Similarly, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) develops
                    evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), which serve as a framework
                    for clinical decisions and supporting best practices. Clinical practice
                    guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize
                    patient care. They are informed by a systematic review of evidence, and an
                    assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. CPGs should
                    follow a sound, transparent methodology to translate best evidence into clinical
                    practice for improved patient outcomes. Additionally, evidence-based CPGs are a

                <title>Guidelines vs SOPs vs Pathways</title>
                <para>Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed, evidence-based
                    recommendations designed to assist healthcare decisions in specific clinical
                    situations. They typically consist of an evidence summary and detailed
                    instructions for applying that evidence to patient care. However, guidelines
                    often require adaptation to local contexts to ensure relevance and encourage
                    adoption by providers.</para>
                <para>SOPs are more specific and detailed than guidelines. They provide
                    comprehensive, rigid criteria and step-by-step instructions for managing a
                    single clinical condition or organizational process. SOPs help bridge the gap
                    between broad, evidence-based guidelines and the realities of clinical practice
                    at the point of care.</para>
                <para>Clinical pathways, meanwhile, translate clinical guidelines into practical,
                    time-sequenced steps for managing defined patient groups or conditions. By
                    operationalizing guidelines into structured workflows, clinical pathways help
                    standardize care delivery and ensure that patients receive consistent,
                    evidence-based management throughout their healthcare journey. [25]</para>

                clinical care by simplifying the treatment options, particularly in primary health
                care. Standard treatment protocols can be developed by preparing new treatment
                guidelines or by adapting or adopting existing national or international guidelines.
                When embedded in electronic health records, treatment protocols can serve as
                clinical decision support at the point of care so no opportunities are missed to
                achieve control. [26] </para>

            <para>A Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact (KNART) is a structured way of
                documenting the knowledge and content used for three different types of CDS
                interventions: 1) event condition action (ECA) rule (e.g., clinical reminder), 2)
                order sets, and 3) documentation templates (VA has called them SMARTForms or PNCS
                forms in the past). </para>
            <para>KNARTs are a standard HL7® format. While they are not the actual executable CDS
                interventions, they provide the information that a developer can take and then
                implement within an EHR. The key advantage of KNARTs lies in their standardization,
                which allows healthcare organizations to share and adopt CDS content efficiently,
                enabling the implementation of best practices across different EHR platforms.</para>
